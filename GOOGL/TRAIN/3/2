Typically, not much changes when you update an app on your phone. But Google Maps added a brilliantly addictive element to the normally simple navigation tool: IT’S MS. PAC-MAN!

The updated version of the app transforms the map of your location into the classic game and allows users to chase the ghosts — or run away from them — around their neighborhoods, complete with the iconic theme song.



It takes a couple attempts — and maybe a life or two — to figure out how to move Ms. Pac-Man around, but once you do, it’s nearly as fun as the traditional arcade game.

You can comfortably play around your neighborhood or drop to any location around the world and take Ms. Pac-Man with you.

Some news outlets are reporting Ms. Pac-Man is this year’s April Fools’ Day prank from Google Maps, and if that’s the case, the game might not be available indefinitely. So pull out your phone, update your app and waste the day away playing one of the greatest games ever created.
