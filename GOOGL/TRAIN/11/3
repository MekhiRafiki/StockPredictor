Google has learned the proper way to make a cheeseburger in Android 8.1
Google CEO Sundar Pichai promised to look into the great cheeseburger emoji debate, and he's made good on his word. Apparently Android 8.1 ships with a new and improved cheeseburger emoji in which the cheese is placed atop the patty, as opposed to underneath it. Emojipedia first spotted the fix.

Google previously pictured the cheese at the bottom of the sandwich, which we can all agree is incorrect. But it wasn't until someone named Thomas Baekdal called the emoji out in October that the world woke up to this extremely incorrect cheeseburger depiction.

 I think we need to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top

Although Google has now realized the proper way to make a cheeseburger, the company did also create its emoji IRL. It served an "Android Burger" to employees earlier this month with the cheese melted onto the bottom bun. I don't know how it tasted.

There are still some slight variations in emoji cheeseburgers. Samsung, for example, layers the sandwich as tomato, cheese, lettuce, and then the patty, whereas Apple depicts its emoji as having tomato, cheese, patty, and then lettuce. Google seems to be on the right track here with its lettuce on top. This is proper. This is how we make a cheeseburger, and I'm thrilled Google has learned.
