Alphabet Needs a New Plan to Get the Stock Going Again. We Have Some Ideas.
Alphabet is facing a sudden growth slowdown in its core advertising business. The problem for investors is that’s about all they know.

On Monday, Google-parent Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) reported first-quarter revenue of $36.3 billion, below Wall Street’s expectation for $37.3 billion. That was up 17% from a year ago, versus the 22% growth in the prior quarter. It was the first time quarterly sales growth came in below the 20% level since early 2016.

The market’s reaction was swift and negative. Alphabet stock plunged 7.5% the day after earnings and closed the week down about 7%. Its shares, at a recent $1,190, are now up just 14% this year, versus a 23% gain for the Nasdaq Composite.

Wall Street blamed a lack of detail around the company’s latest results for the stock’s dramatic fall. The sales growth “deceleration and uncertain forward trajectory highlight the need for better transparency,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a report on Tuesday.


Alphabet’s vague disclosures worked fine when growth was booming, but it’s problematic when that growth turns south. Speculation about what’s gone wrong quickly turned to YouTube’s attempts to clean up its site. The company has talked about that issue more of late, though never in a way that addresses the financial implications.

In a New York Times interview last month, Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive officer of YouTube, spoke at length about removing harmful content faster and more effectively. YouTube is now pursuing “responsible growth,” Wojcicki said.

Similarly, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on this past week’s earnings call that YouTube is focused on “content responsibility” and is working to reduce low-quality content.

A safer YouTube with less extremist content could be impacting ad sales, but who really knows. In the absence of details, investors tend to assume the worst. It’s wiser to be transparent and offer clear disclosures even if it leads to short-term pressure on the stock. The payoff is more trust from investors over the long run.


RBC’s Mark Mahaney believes clarity on YouTube’s size is the big issue on the minds of investors. “There’s an assumption on the Street that YouTube last year generated about 15% to 20% of the company’s total revenue,” he says. “The market would like some sort of confirmation of that.” Mahaney has an Outperform rating for Alphabet shares and a $1,300 price target.

In similar fashion, ARK Invest’s James Wang, whose firm owns Alphabet shares, tells Barron’s in an email that he would love to see additional revenue and profit margin disclosures for YouTube, Google Cloud Platform, and Google Play App store.

There’s another arguably more important reform that should come out of Alphabet’s rare slip-up. The company is too stingy with its shareholders. Alphabet bought back just $3 billion in stock during its March quarter, just above the $2.8 billion it spent in stock-based compensation for the quarter. As a result, the company’s share count stayed flat year-over-year. Compare that with Apple (AAPL), which is buying back huge amounts of stock every quarter. Apple’s share count is down 6% over the last year thanks to buybacks.

The share repurchases are a big reason why Apple shares have significantly outperformed the indexes this year even as iPhone sales are falling. Alphabet executives may need to employ a similar tactic if its own growth continues to slow. The good news is that Alphabet can afford to pay back shareholders—in a big way.


Mahaney estimates that Google has more than 70% market share of the global search ad-revenue market. The dominance helped the company generate $23 billion in free cash flow last year. Analysts predict material annual free-cash flow growth for years into the future.

With a cash pile that’s grown to $109 billion, after subtracting debt, Alphabet could actually afford a massive $100 billion buyback. (Apple just authorized an additional $75 billion for its buybacks.)

With the current regulatory environment scrutinizing big technology acquisitions, share buybacks may be the only game in town for cash-rich tech firms.

Alphabet did not respond to a request for comment about its capital allocation plans or its disclosure practices.


Barron’s wrote positively about Alphabet a year ago. The stock is up 18% since then. The bullish arguments still make sense. Even if growth has slowed a bit, there are no competitive threats on the horizon.


On top of its core ad businesses, Alphabet has several early-stage businesses in high-growth markets, including autonomous-driving technology from its Waymo subsidiary and cloud computing. The businesses participate in what are already trillion-dollar markets or could be in the foreseeable future, according to RBC Capital. The problem is that investors have no good way of measuring where Alphabet stands with these efforts.

Alphabet trades at 24 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, versus 17 times for the S&P 500. Even after the latest results, analysts still expect Alphabet’s sales to grow 17.5% this year. Aggregate sales in the S&P 500 are seen growing just 5% on the year. So Alphabet still looks reasonably priced.

But the company can no longer count on just ad growth to support the stock multiple. It’s time for Alphabet’s “side-projects” to step up. For that to happen, management needs to rethink its secretive ways and report real numbers on all its businesses.


More importantly, the company should stop hoarding its cash and reward its patient investors with a proper buyback.
