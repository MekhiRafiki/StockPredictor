Google's parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reports earnings, shares fall
Alphabet Inc. revenue growth cooled off at the start of 2019, according to an earnings report Monday afternoon that sent shares down more than 5% in after-hours trading.
Google’s parent company came up short of expectations as all of its major sales categories performed slightly worse than projected in the first quarter, and yet another big fine out of Europe dinged the company’s earnings. AlphabetGOOGL, -7.23% GOOG, -7.19%  reported first-quarter earnings of $6.66 billion, or $9.50 a share, on revenue of $29.48 billion, after removing traffic-acquisition costs; a year ago in the same period, Alphabet posted profit of $13.33 a share on ex-TAC sales of $24.86 billion a year ago.

Alphabet’s earnings would have been $11.90 a share were it not for a $1.7 billion fine out of Europe for its online-advertising practices. Analysts on average expected ex-TAC sales of $30.04 billion and earnings of $10.60 a share, according to FactSet, and were largely ignoring the fine in their estimates.

Revenue grew at a rate lower than 20% — sales grew 16.7%, 18.6% when factoring in TAC — a level Alphabet has managed to hold over the past two years. In 2018, Alphabet sales grew 23.4%, and no single quarter showed year-over-year growth lower than 20%.

Alphabet breaks up its business into three core areas: Google advertising, other Google revenue and “Other Bets,” which are the non-Google businesses. Advertising is the most important business, bringing in the bulk of the revenue. In the first quarter, sales in that category totaled $30.72 billion without factoring in TAC, coming up short of analyst expectations of $31.48 billion. The company reported advertising revenue of $27.23 billion a year ago, pushing the sales-growth rate for that business to 15.3%, a deceleration from the fourth quarter’s rate of about 20%.


Google’s other businesses — Play Store, hardware and Google Cloud — reported revenue of $5.45 billion, missing expectations of $5.67 billion, while Other Bets claimed revenue of $170 million against expectations of $172 million. Other Bets also reported an operating loss of $868 million, a jump from $571 million a year ago and appreciably worse than the average analyst estimate of $640 million.

While Alphabet’s venture-capital investing activity is not broken out in financial disclosures, it does have a big effect on earnings. Gains on investments added more than $4 billion in profit in 2018, and 2019 started similarly, with Google reporting $1.08 billion in gains on equity securities. Much of that is thought to be the increase in the value of shares of Lyft Inc. LYFT, -1.04%  , which went public earlier this year.
