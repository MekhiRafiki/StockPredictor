Alphabet Q1 Report On Tap As Shares Continue To Rip
Summary
GOOGL shares are up more than 20% since the start of the year.

Q1 results may reveal whether advertising prices are still weighing on GOOGL’s margins.

Q1 earnings and revenue are expected to slide from last year’s Q1 results.

Even amid pressure from increased competition in online advertising, Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) shares have been on a rip this year, up about 21.5% year to date as of April 24, vs. a 17% rise in the S&P 500. The search engine giant is scheduled to release Q1 results after the closing bell April 29.

Google is a kind of bellwether for big players in the technology sector. For much of 2018, FAANGs’ momentum helped drive a solid rally for much of the year, and then played a large role in Q4’s steep losses. So far this year, FAANGs have had a lesser role in the more broad-based rally, but their positive drive has certainly also contributed.

GOOGL itself doesn’t provide quarterly guidance, but the Street expects it to report Q1 adjusted EPS of $10.56, down from $13.33 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $37.33 billion, up 19.9% from a year ago.

Digital Advertising Revenue Hit Plateau in Q4
In Q4, GOOGL shares slid about 3% after it reported rising costs and a decline in advertising prices, where it gleans a good deal of revenue. Its core advertising revenue grew 20% to $32.6 billion, which was about the same rate of growth it saw in Q3, meaning that line of business had hit a bit of a plateau. Meanwhile, the costs for traffic acquisition, for example what it pays to other companies to be a default search engine, climbed 15% year over year to $7.44 billion.

Still, GOOGL showed it continued to expand its hardware sales and cloud business, and earnings and revenue topped Street estimates. Q4 revenue was $39.3 billion, up 22% from the year prior, and earnings were $12.77 per share, up 12% year over year.

Its “other revenue,” which includes Google Play, hardware and cloud computing, increased 31% year-over-year to $6.49 billion, although the company did not break down that number to show exactly where the growth came from. CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call that Google Cloud was one of the company’s “fastest-growing business segments.” He also said the company “more than doubled” the number of Cloud Platform deals over $1 million and the number of multi-year contracts, although he didn’t provide specifics.
