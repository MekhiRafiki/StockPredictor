The investigation determined that Maddox was in possession of an assault firearm and a large capacity ammunition magazine, which he discarded, the release said.

On Tuesday night, a post on the Piscataway Police Department's Facebook page indicated that they "are actively and aggressively investigating the origin of this message."

"This investigation is still very active and fluid," the Facebook post said. "Although the social media post did not specify an exact location, or even a school, we are taking this very seriously. We continue to work with the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office and our other law enforcement partners to determine the exact origins of this Snapchat post."
